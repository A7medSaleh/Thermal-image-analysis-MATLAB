This code is very useful in analyzing any kind of thermal image given that the image contain a colormap scale. After analysis the user can extract the temperature in very accurate value at any specific point in the analysis area also the code can detect the hotspots (areas of highest temperatures) by highlighting it in green and it returns the average temperature in this hot area.
The code is implemented in a GUI (user friendly) to facilitate using the program and it runs on MATLAB platform.

This software can be used in various fields like detecting defects in electric circuits by analyzing its thermal images to detect parts of high temperature. Analyzing thermal imaging of human body and measuring body temperature very accurately.
